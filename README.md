# YouTube Tutorials

This is a repo where I keep stuff that I have used in 
YouTube videos.

Install with 

```bash
pip install .
```

I have also added the possibilty to use `pipenv` if you are into that kind of thing..

```bash
pipenv install
``` 

Enter the environment with  the usual

```bash
pipenv shell
```

Hurray! Amazing.
